# UnrealEngineProject0
In this project I learnt about the use of Blueprints with Unreal Engine 5.

**Blueprint 0 - Door Blueprint** </br>
Function: When the player moves up to the door and presses the E key
the door will slowly rotate open and allow the player to move through it. If the
player presses the E key again, the door will close.

**Blueprint 1 - Hat Pickup** </br>
Function: When the player moves towards the hat and presses the E key.
The hat mesh will be destroyed and a new Hat mesh will be added the the player
mesh.

**Blueprint 2 - Health Damage area and Health Replenish Area** </br>
Funstion: When the player stands on the Damage area their HP will decrease
When the player stands on the Health area their HP will increase. Once full the player
will be prompted that their health has reached the limit. This blueprint also adds in the 
player Health Bar.

**Blueprint 3 - Soccer Goal & Ball** </br>
Function: When the player moves towards the ball they will be able to push it into
the goal. The goal has a collision that checks the ball and restarts the balls position 
after 2 seconds of it going in. There is also a particle effect that will be played when a 
goal is made.

**Blueprint 4 - Obstical Course** </br>
Function: When the obsticle hits the player from the direction it is swinging in it will
cast a ragdoll effect on the player and cause it to be pushed away. After 5 seconds the character will
respawn in place.
